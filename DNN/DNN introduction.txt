#Overview
DNN is a type of artificial neural network that consists of multiple layers of 
interconnected nodes or neurons. These networks are typically composed of 
three main types of layers: the input layer, the hidden layers, and the output 
layer. The input layer receives the raw data, the hidden layers process this data 
through weighted connections and nonlinear activation functions, and the output 
layer produces the final result or prediction. 

Compared to MLP, DNN has higher number of hidden layers, which allows it to 
learn and model more complex patterns and relationships in data. Also, DNN 
uses backpropagation to update the weight so that it can improve the accuracy 
of prediction. However, the additional layers also introduce more cost and 
typically require more data and longer training times than MLP.
